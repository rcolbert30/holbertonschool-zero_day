# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

**What I should learn from this project**

At the end of this project I expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using print
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
